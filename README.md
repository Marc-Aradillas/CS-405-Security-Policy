# Project Overview

### **CS 405: Secure Coding & Security Policies**

This repository contains the deliverables for **CS 405** related to **Secure Coding** and **Security Policies**. It includes the following project components:

- **Project One: Security Policy Document**  
- **Project Two: Security Policy Presentation**  
- **Coding ZIP files**  
- **Portfolio Journal Reflection**  

### **Project Description**

In this project, we are tasked with developing and presenting a security policy to ensure secure coding practices and adherence to security principles. The focus is on identifying vulnerabilities, implementing best practices for secure coding, and leveraging automation to detect potential security flaws. The policy includes encryption strategies, the use of the Triple-A framework, and secure coding standards.

## Contents

- **Project One: Security Policy Document**  
  This section contains the security policy guide, which outlines the coding standards and security practices for Green Pace. It includes detailed policies for secure coding, risk management, and threat mitigation.
  
- **Project Two: Security Policy Presentation**  
  This is the narrated presentation that walks through the policy implementation, demonstrating the use of unit testing, encryption strategies, and the Triple-A framework.
  
- **Coding ZIP files**  
  Contains all relevant code files that demonstrate the coding standards and security measures implemented in the policy. Includes unit testing frameworks and examples of code vulnerabilities with corresponding solutions.

- **Portfolio Journal Reflection (Word document)**  
  A reflective journal discussing key topics in secure coding, evaluation of risk, and cost-benefit analysis of security policies. Includes insights on Zero Trust and recommendations for security policy implementation.
